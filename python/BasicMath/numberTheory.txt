what is prime number?
the number which has the factor 1 or itself is the prime number
example 2, 3, 5, 7....

what is composite numbers?
the number which are non prime number are composite numbers

factors of number?
factors are 1 to N
example: 44

1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44

lets say if i know the first half 1, 2, 4 by dividing the number by the given value which is 44
 like 44/1, 44/2, 44/4 then i know the remaming numbers which are 11, 22, 44

so suppose the factors are 1 to N and the middle numbers m

which mean 1....m.....n where the n is m x m (2x22, 11 x 4, 1 x 44 )

then n = m**2

where m = âˆšn
example square root of 44 is 6 
we have 6 factors

Note: Every natural number is either prime number or can be formed by prime number
example 22 not prime but for 22 we have 2 11 where 2 and 11 are prime which gives 22 

what is GCD(greatest common Divisor)?
GCD of Two more integer is the largest interger that divides the two more interger

if gcd((a,b)) = c
where a/c, b/c will be the zero remainder

example:
8, 12

prime factors of 8 and 12
8 - 2, 2, 2
12 - 2, 2, 3
which gives 2 and 2 common then 4

note: gcd of two numbers which has nothing common then it is co prime/ relativly prime 

what is lcm?
the smallest positive integer that divides the both interger 

example 4, 6
4 - 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28..
6 - 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...

the least common multiple is 12
